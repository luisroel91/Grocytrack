          Tired of using your phone calculator to keep track of your grocery
          trips?
          <br />
          Tired of pressing the heckin' clear button and not remembering how
          much your cart is worth?
          <br />
          Want to avoid the uncomfortable situation of getting to the register
          and not knowing what the bill will be?
          <br />
          Want to keep better track of your grocery purchases and food habits?
        </p>
        <p>
          Cool! Us too!
          <br />
          <br />
          So <strong>we</strong> made this...
          <br />
          <br />
          For <strong>you</strong>!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          But also because...if we were afraid of what we'd do...
          <br />
          if we pressed the clear button accidentally <br />
          <br />
          <strong>one...more...time :)</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
